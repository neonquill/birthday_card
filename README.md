# Birthday card code for ATtiny13A

A quick hack to create a musical birthday card.  Plays "You Are My
Sunshine" and blinks three LEDs.

## Hardware

A speaker is connected to pin 5 (PB0).  The LEDs are connected to pins
2, 3, and 7 (PB2, PB3, PB4).

The wiring was created on the card using a [Bare Paint
Pen](http://www.bareconductive.com/ "Bare Conductive") This has enough
resistance to not need any physical resistors.  When prototyping,
current limiting resistors should be used on the speaker and the LEDs.
